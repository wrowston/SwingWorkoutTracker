# SwingWorkoutTracker
A Java Swing application that works the same as the workout tracker project I created. See WorkoutTracker for details on program logic. 

This application is another form of my Workout Tracker to practice Java Swing. The application connects to MongoDB Compass 
to store the workouts submitted by the user. The user can also use the application to search completed workouts
via "date" or has the option to show all completed workouts.
